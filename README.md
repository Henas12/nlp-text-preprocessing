## 🧰 Features

- **Tokenization:** Splitting text into words or sentences.
- **Stemming and Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root forms.
- **Stop-word Removal:** Filtering out common words (like "and", "is", etc.).
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
- **Word Vectorization:** Transforming text into numerical representations using techniques like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.
